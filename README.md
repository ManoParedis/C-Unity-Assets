# C# Unity Projects

In this Repo I have added some C# code that is use the most for my Unity Projects. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Description of the code

* **Mouselook** - *This code makes the Camera attached to the player a First Person Camera.* 
* **ParallaxBackground** - *Makes a Photo (made in photoshop) with layers into a 2D Parallaxeffect. It makes the photo more "3D".* 
* **Parallaxlayer** - *Lets ParallaxBackground know how the leyers of the photo moves (foreground moves faster than the background).* 
* **PlayerController** - *Code for getting inputs for the movement of the player.* 
* **PlayerPlatformerController** - *The same as PlayerController but especially made for 2D Games.* 
* **Rotator** - *Makes a Rigidbody rotate on its axis.* 
* **SmoothMouseLook** - *For adding more effect to a First Person Camera.* 
* **ThirdPerson** - *Makes a ThirdPerson Camera that follows the player.* 

### Prerequisites

Make a Asset folder inside Unity and name it "Scripts" (Call it whatever you want). After this step just drag your C# script in the Unity Object and change the code what you prefer to use inside your Unity Project.

## Running the tests

If the code works inside Unity and does what the description does then this means you are doing it right.
